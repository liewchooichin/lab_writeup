DIDRB

1) Can I use multiple wordfiles at a time?

YES, the wordfile parameter let you specify multiple files separated by 
coma: ","

2) I Know 3 directories to exist, how can I scan they?

You have 2 options:

- Scan directly each directory. For example:

	$./dirb http://www.site.com/directory1/ wordlist.txt

	$./dirb http://www.site.com/directory2/ wordlist.txt

	$./dirb http://www.site.com/directory3/ wordlist.txt

- Include the name of the 3 directories in a text file (one directory by line)
and use it like a wordfile. DIRB will found the directories and scan into it. 
For example:

	$./dirb http://www.site.com/ wordlist.txt,dirnamefile.txt

Content of dirnamefile.txt:
----------------
directory1
directory2
directory3
----------------
